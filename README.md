# Python Calculator
Python calculator is a calculator made in Python. It understands human language and is capable of doing basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

You can tell it to do a calculation, like:

*Hey, what is five plus five?* or
*I bet you don't know what is 6 times 9 plus six plus nine!*

Be sure to refer to the 'help' command for help.

NOTE: If prompted in any case, you can just type in `calculator` to initialize the program.
